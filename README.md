AtliQ Hardwares is an international company specializing in the sale of various hardware products such as PCs, mice, printers, and more.  With a diverse portfolio of over 50 products, the company serves customers across 23 different countries.  Currently, AtliQ Hardwares manages its sales and operations data through a multitude of Excel files. As the volume of data has grown, this method has become increasingly cumbersome and inefficient, making it difficult to maintain accurate records, generate timely reports, and derive actionable insights. 

To address these challenges, the top executives of AtliQ Hardwares have identified the need for a more streamlined and automated reporting system. The goal is to consolidate and analyze the data from these Excel files to create comprehensive reports that can inform strategic decisions, improve operational efficiency, and enhance overall business performance.
